For example, here is a Nextflow pipeline I developed for finding the optimal hyperparameters for integrating multiple single-cell datasets using scVI.\nI also gained expertise developing R shiny apps (example here) and R packages (example here).\n\nMSc in Biomedical Genomics | University of Galway | Galway, Ireland | Sept 2018 - July 2019\n\nDuring my MSc I undertook intense training in all aspects of genomics data analysis and consistently achieved high grades (1.1. overall grade).\nI was awarded a scholarship to conduct my MSc research project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, where I gained my first introduction to single-cell RNA-seq analysis. My project here focused on characterising transcriptional heterogeneity between tissue-resident macrophage subsets.\n\nBSc in Human Health & Disease | Trinity College Dublin | Dublin, Ireland | Sept 2013 - July 2017\n\nMy undergraduate degree provided me with a strong foundation in the field of human biology. I studied the fundamentals of cell structure and function, immunology, genetics, neuroscience and anatomy and physiology. I also conducted a research project entitled “Identiﬁcation of biomarkers for the biological characterisation and diagnosis of Rett Syndrome” under the supervision of Dr Daniela Tropea."
