::: {.about-me}
Hi there! ![](gnome.png){.gnome-pic} 
:::

I'm Sarah, a **bioinformatician and data scientist** with 5 years of experience.

I'm originally from **Dublin, Ireland** and currently based in **Kingston, Ontario**.

I also have a keen interest in **data visualisation** and enjoy developing **R Shiny** apps and R packages.

I'm currently open to job opportunities that are either **hybrid** in the Toronto area or **remote**, anywhere in Canada.
