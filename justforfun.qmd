As if I don't spend enough hours on these things at work, I also enjoy genomics and data visualisation in my spare time. Here's some examples of data visualisations I've created for the [#30DayChartChallenge](https://github.com/Sarah145/30DayChartChallenge) on Twitter.

I had my own genome sequenced a few years ago and enjoy making different abstract visualisations of the data. The plots below are generated using my genome sequence data.

I also developed an R Shiny app (cleverly titled [*SarahSeq*](https://github.com/Sarah145/SarahSeq)) for exploring and visualing my genome. The app should work with any VCF file (not just those from people named Sarah).
