## Positions of Responsibility

-   One of two student representatives for my PhD cohort, which involved planning events and liaising with the program managers if any students had issues (2019-2023).
-   I was also a student representative on the Executive Management Committee for my PhD program, which involved going to regular management meetings and contributing a student's perspective to any decisions being made (2019-2022).
-   In May 2022 I founded a monthly Single-Cell Journal Club for single-cell researchers in Ireland.
-   In December 2020, I was a member of the organising committee for a successful student-run virtual symposium on Computational Genomics and Systems Biology.
-   I designed and delivered a short online data visualisation workshop as part of a Data Science for Life Scientists course during the pandemic. You can find it [here](https://github.com/Genomics-CRT/Data-Science-For-Life-Science/tree/master/Introduction_to_R/part_3).
-   I have plenty of experience teaching and have been giving tutorials and delivering workshops in genomics data science and single-cell transcriptomics to MSc and PhD students since 2019.
